### Placeholder

Clojure:

    (defmacro success->
      "When (success? expr) is truthy, threads it into the first form (via ->),
      and when (success? that result) is truthy, through the next etc"
      [expr & forms]
      (let [g (gensym)
            pstep (fn [step] `(if (success? ~g) (-> ~g ~step) ~g))]
        `(let [~g ~expr
               ~@(interleave (repeat g) (map pstep forms))]
           ~g)))


and some Elm:

    prod l =
      case l of
        [] -> 1
        h::t -> h * (prod t)
